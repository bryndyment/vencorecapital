								<h2>Vencore Capital Expands into Leading Markets</h2>
								<p><strong>LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., May 31, 2006</strong> – Vencore Capital (formerly known as VenCore Solutions), a leading provider of venture debt financing solutions to early stage, emerging-growth companies, today announced that it has recently opened new offices in Silicon Valley and in Colorado. The new locations will focus on emerging-growth companies in their regions and are led by veterans of the venture banking industry.</p>
								<p><strong>Silicon Valley</strong></p>
								<p>Vencore's Silicon Valley office will be led by Jon Krogstad. Jon has 15 years' experience providing innovative financial solutions to emerging-technology companies. Prior to joining Vencore, he was a founding member and manager of Greater Bay Bancorp's Venture Banking Group, where he built a team that grew the company to more than $600 million in assets. Earlier in his career, Jon held lending positions at Cupertino National Bank and Union Bank. Jon has a B.S. degree in business administration with a finance concentration, graduating as the Dean's Medalist from California State University Fresno.
								<p><strong>Colorado</strong></p>
								<p>Vencore's office in the fast-growing Rocky Mountain region is led by Silicon Valley Bank veteran David Dolezal. The office will serve companies in Colorado, Utah and the Southwest. David has 15 years of experience in providing financing solutions to technology companies from start-up to IPO and beyond. Prior to joining Vencore, David served as a vice president and relationship manager with Silicon Valley Bank in Boulder, Colorado for seven years. In this role, he was responsible for providing a variety of financing solutions, including leases, term loans, revolving lines of credit, and structured asset-based loans to technology company clients. David has a B.S. degree in business administration with a concentration in finance and accounting from Portland State University.</p>
								<p>"We're happy to welcome Jon and David to our team," said Len Ludwig, CEO of Vencore Capital. "There is a rapidly-growing demand for venture debt-related services in these two regions, and the contribution of these two talented professionals will enable us to deliver the rapid response and financial expertise that young companies require to meet critical milestones."</p>

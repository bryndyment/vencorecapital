Vencore distinguishes itself from other lenders by our commitment to provide capital earlier in a company\'s lifecycle â€” prior to traditional venture-capital financing â€” and through our willingness to do smaller deals with more flexible structures and pricing. Our approach is to match the size, structure and pricing to our clients\' risk profiles. Our deals typically range from $50K to $2M.</p>\r\n<p>With relatively small, well-timed infusions of cash from Vencore, you can:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acquire critical human resources and capital equipment</li>\r\n	<li>Complete strategic product development activities</li>\r\n	<li>Implement key go-to-market strategies</li>\r\n	<li>Build brand and market awareness</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>By pushing out your next round of equity financing â€” <a href=\"/products/extend_your_reach/\">extending your reach</a> â€” until you achieve one or more of these strategic initiatives, you increase your company\'s valuation with less dilution for investors, founders and other early shareholders.</p>\r\n<p>Vencore is successful because we focus squarely on customer satisfaction and hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards. As a result, we have established lifetime partnerships with more than 200 angel- and venture capital-backed companies and have provided more than $100 million in venture debt financing. We maintain a strong local presence in communities throughout the U.S. and offer highly individualized support designed to help ensure our clients\' success.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,914031982,'','',0,0,0,0),(818231201,2,0,'Management Team','/company/management_team/',1,1,0,'2007-07-14 17:45:57','<p>Many of Vencore\'s executive team and managing directors have served the emerging-growth company market for more than 15 years.

Venture debt can be structured as a lease or a loan. It gives early-stage, emerging-growth companies the capital they need to undertake strategic initiatives, develop product, acquire equipment, build out infrastructure, and expand into new business markets.</p>\r\n<p>Venture debt is sometimes focused on equipment financing and is structured as a loan or a lease. Other times, venture debt provides working capital and is typically structured as a growth capital loan. In either case, it can help founders and early investors avoid dilution through an infusion of cash that \"extends the runway\" between equity rounds.</p>\r\n<p>For venture capitalists, venture debt leverages equity capital investments, providing stability to their portfolios by adding additional financial resources. In addition, venture debt augments equity returns through its lower capital costs.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"2\"><strong>Q.</strong> What if we have not received institutional venture capital?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> A company does not need to have raised traditional institutional venture capital before establishing a relationship with Vencore. Many of our clients are self-funded, have received only seed funding, or are funded by angels, grants, or corporate investors.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"3\"><strong>Q.</strong> How is Vencore different from a bank?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Vencore is a provider of growth capital and equipment financing and is not the same type of service provider as a bank. We understand the risks, challenges, and opportunities companies face in their early years, and our products are designed for companies that do not yet qualify for bank term loans. If a company does qualify for bank financing, a good option is to finance equipment with Vencore and use a bank for a short-term operating line of credit secured by accounts receivable.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"4\"><strong>Q.</strong> What are the key terms of a typical Vencore deal?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Our deals range in size from $50K to $2M. The term typically ranges from 24 to 36 months. Our compensation includes commitment fees, interest income, and warrants. We occupy the space between a commercial bank and an equity investor. We take more risk than a bank and dilute equity less than venture funding.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"5\"><strong>Q.</strong> What other resources can Vencore offer our company?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Through its strong presence in cities throughout the U.S., Vencore has formed relationships with commercial real estate firms, attorneys, and organizations that provide interim management expertise to early-stage companies. In addition, because we are well known by many angel groups and other venture capital providers, we can often help companies rise above the \"noise level\" by making appropriate introductions.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"6\"><strong>Q.</strong> What types of assets does Vencore finance?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Companies use cash raised from Vencore loans and leases for asset purchases and working capital.</p>\r\n<p>Vencore finances most types of fixed assets, including computer hardware and software and telecommunications hardware. We also finance manufacturing, laboratory, office, and test and measurement equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Our growth capital loans are generally secured by all corporate assets. The cash from the loan is used for working capital purposes such as paying salaries and other costs associated with product development and roll-out.</p>\r\n<p>Our bias is to get the deal done and find creative ways to make that happen.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"7\"><strong>Q.</strong> Does Vencore require personal guarantees from company officers?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> We do not normally require personal guarantees.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"anchor\" name=\"8\"><strong>Q.</strong> What geographic areas does Vencore serve?</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Vencore has regional offices across the U.S. and serves clients throughout the country.

We match the size, structure and pricing of our loans and leases to a client\'s risk profile. A typical venture debt arrangement ranges from $50K to $2M and is repaid over two to three years. We custom-tailor terms to a client\'s specific needs and stage of development.</p>\r\n<p>Vencore offers the following four types of products:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Seed Stage</strong> â€” These smaller ($50K to $300K) loans or leases help highly promising startups that have not raised venture capital and whose needs are relatively small.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Early Equipment Stage</strong> â€” These larger ($200K to $750K) loans or leases are designed for angel- or VC-backed companies typically in the R&amp;D or early revenue stage.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Early-Stage Growth Capital</strong> â€” These loans (typically $250K to $750K) fund operating expenses and growth but are not tied to acquisition of a specific asset. We offer them exclusively to companies with supportive investors and whose performance closely tracks plans.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Later-Stage Growth Capital</strong> â€” These larger loans ($0.5M to $2M) generally offer larger amounts of growth capital or equipment loans/leases to more mature companies. We offer them to companies whose cash flow will remain positive over the life of the debt or who have secured an equity investment to support debt service. Growing enterprise value is our primary consideration in deciding to offer this type of arrangement.</li>\r\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,2,783734130,'','',0,0,0,0),(342797851,2,0,'Typical Financing','/company/typical_financing/',1,1,0,'2007-07-16 19:12:57','<h2>Equipment Loans and Leases</h2>\r\n<p>Many Vencore clients choose to finance equipment rather than purchase it. This strategy is sound. Once you commit cash to fixed assets, it is not available for product and market development and other activities that increase your chance of success.</p>\r\n<p>An equipment loan or lease is an effective way to \"<a href=\"/products/extend_your_reach/\">extend the cash runway</a>.\" In essence, you are stretching the payment timeline, repaying the loan with proceeds from a new round of financing or ramping revenue. At this juncture, money is cheaper, because your companyâ€™s valuation is higher.</p>\r\n<p>Before making an equipment loan, Vencore analyzes your business plan and assesses management and investor quality. If we conclude that your company is likely to continue its forward momentum, we make the loan.</p>\r\n<p>If you prefer to lease equipment, we actively assist in the process, pay the vendor directly, and own the equipment. If you decide to go with a loan, you deal directly with the vendor and are reimbursed by Vencore. Each strategy has advantages for you.</p>\r\n<h2>Growth Capital Loans</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies want to raise cash to help fund research and development, product launches, and go-to-market strategies. Vencore considers this type of loan \"growth capital.\"</p>\r\n<p>Candidates for growth capital loans are solid companies with a demonstrated ability to raise equity capital and successfully get products to market.</p>\r\n<p>Growth capital helps companies pay for expenses, thereby deferring the need for equity financing. It can also be used to support the growth of accounts receivable and inventory, but is usually not tied directly to specific asset purchases.</p>\r\n<p>To secure this type of loan, you grant Vencore a blanket filing on your company assets, which often includes its intellectual property.</p>\r\n<h2>Loan and Lease Terms</h2>\r\n<p>Vencore usually expects repayment of loans or leases over two to three years. Your monthly payments include an implicit interest rate. At the end of the term, you can buy leased equipment from Vencore at fair market value. In the case of a loan, you make a final payment that includes a deferred fee.</p>\r\n<p>Venture debt offers business value by allowing you to defer equity financing until a milestone is passed that raises your companyâ€™s valuation. In consideration for this value, you grant Vencore a warrant to purchase stock. Warrant size varies with deal size, current valuation, and several other factors.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,437108028,'','',0,0,0,0),(465885695,4,0,'MODA Technology Partners',NULL,1,1,0,'2009-02-23 17:54:05',NULL,NULL,'www.modatp.com',0,0,NULL,'',2,5,0,0),(266249837,4,0,'Blink Twice',NULL,1,1,0,'2007-08-10 15:21:20',NULL,NULL,'www.blink-twice.com',0,0,NULL,'',2,1,0,0),(971348415,4,0,'ThinkEngine Networks',NULL,1,1,0,'2007-08-10 15:21:20',NULL,NULL,'www.thinkengine.com',0,0,NULL,'',1,6,0,0),(197947066,4,0,'Nimbit',NULL,1,1,0,'2007-08-10 15:21:20',NULL,NULL,'www.nimbit.com',0,0,NULL,'',1,5,0,0),(888891827,4,0,'Nexus Energy Software',NULL,1,1,0,'2007-08-10 15:21:20',NULL,NULL,'www.nexusenergy.com',0,0,NULL,'',1,5,0,0),(893666346,2,0,'Portfolio Clients','/clients/',1,1,0,'2007-08-10 15:33:31','<p>Vencore has over 250 clients across the U.S. from a broad range of industries.
